##### Abstract

The widespread presence of garbage in many rapidly developing cities highlights a major urbanization challenge: the swift growth in population is outstripping the capabilities of urban infrastructure. Bengaluru is a prime example of this; between 2000 and 2015, garbage output has increased from 200 tons per day to 3,7000 tons per day, a 1750% increase. During this time, the population of Bengaluru has increased 80%. We will study the spatial distribution of waste generation and public waste service provision throughout Bengaluru. This will inform the design of targeted supply- and demand-side interventions intended to expand the reach and quality of waste services.
